My recent project to learn TypeScript, Next.js and Tailwind was to create a landing page. I found a tutorial on YouTube that I followed to create the landing page.

The tutorial is from [**Takuya Matsuyama**](https://www.youtube.com/@devaslife) and it's in english. The tutorial is very good and it's easy to follow. Takuya is a very good developer and I like his videos a lot. He transmits calm and confidence. I recommend you to follow his channel.

The landing page have tricky animations like parallax effect and a sticky parallax effect. I recommend it to anyone who wants to learn how to create a landing page. The code is private but you can see my final result on my [**Github**](https://github.com/jordicapellad3s/landing-page).

I deploy the final result on [**Vercel**](https://vercel.com/) and you can see the result [**here**](https://margelo-landing.vercel.app/).
