Today I discovered a new extension for productivity. This extension is called [**Otto**](https://ottoapp.me/). Otto is a Chrome extension with a pomodoro timer with a website blocker so you can be focused and productive while working or studying.

When you start the timer it will block the websites you don't want to visit to waste time.

I use it everyday to focus on my work.

You can find the Chrome extension [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/otto-%E2%80%93-pomodoro-timer-and/jbojhemhnilgooplglkfoheddemkodld).
