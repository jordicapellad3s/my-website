I just started an API REST for my first time. So I decided to search for some best practices. I found some of them in the following links:

- [API REST best practices](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/rest-api-design-best-practices-build-a-rest-api/#basic-setup)

This post by Jean-Marc MÃ¶ckel is a good example of how to use the best practices.
