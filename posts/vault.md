I have been working on a project called **Vault**. It is a simple password manager that I am building to learn more about **Laravel Breeze + React** and **Tailwind**. My goal is to have a simple password manager that I can use to store my passwords and have them available on all my devices.

Right now I am working on the web version and I am planning to build a mobile version in the future. But for now, I am happy with the web version.

Keep in mind that this is a work in progress and I am still working on it. I am not a designer so the UI is not the best but I am working on it. Here is a screenshot of the web version:
