Today I read a tweet that say:

> Your first podcast will be bad.
> Your first video will be bad.
> Your first web page will be bad.
> Your first post will be bad.
> Your first day at everything will be horrible.
> But you can't do your #50 without doing your first.
> The beginning is always the hardest part of everything.
> Just do it.

So if you start something new, its hard but you can do it. Stay focus on the path you are taking.
