I'm already finished the book Habits atomics by **James Clear** and I recommend this book to the people who want to start a new habit or remove one of his life.

3 months ago, I started a habit to do **50 push-ups** in the morning to start the day with the mentality to break my lazy start days. It's work very powerful.

One of the tips that James Clear give in the book is to do a **habit tracker**. This habit tracker is a simple page where you write your habits and have a table on you marks with an 'x' when you do the habit.

It's **satisfying** to mark the 'x' on every day and see the journey after one month.
