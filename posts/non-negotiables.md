If you want to change who you are, you must change what you do, how you speak, and how you think. You need **NON-NEGOTIABLE** things daily.

This are my daily non negociables:

### Sun exposure:

We need to be in the sun at least 30 minutes a day. The sun is the source of all energy. It is the source of all life. Keep the sunscreen and your sunsglases away because the body and your eyes are the only source of light.

### Grounding:

Grounding or Earthing is the contact of your body with nature. Grounding is the contact of your body with the earth. So keep your feet and your hands on the ground. Your body get charge with the electrons from the earth.

### Wim Hof method:

Wim Hof, also known as The Iceman is a Ducth motivational speaker and extreme athlete noted for his ability to withstand low temperatures.

The Wim Hof method have 3 parts to it: Breathing, Cold Exposure and Meditation.

### Meditation and Visualization

Mindful meditation is the practice of focusing on the present moment and the future. The mindfulness guided meditation is a technique that helps you to become aware of your thoughts and feelings.

### Movement

Move your body if you want to live a longer and healthier life. We are designed to move not to stay in the sofa wathing Netflix. So if you're not moving, you're not living.
